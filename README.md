# WashingMachine

WashingMachine is a VHDL program, which simulates the working process of how a washing machine works.

The washing machine has the functionality of LED time keeper, Ring function after time out and differen washing modes. Mainly all the basic functionality of a washing machine.

I used quartus to do the simulation and used a C51 board to test it.
